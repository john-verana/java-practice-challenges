💻 Java Practice Challenges
This repository contains my weekly Java coding practice challenges.
I'm currently learning Java from scratch and using this repo to track my progress and build a strong GitHub portfolio as I grow.

📅 Weekly Focus
✅ Week 1: While Loops
✅ Learn how to repeat logic with a while loop
✅ Apply it in basic interactive apps
✅ Upload at least two working projects

✅ Week 2: User Input (Scanner)
✅ Learn how to take input from users using Scanner
✅ Build basic input/output programs
✅ Handle login attempts with logic and string comparison

🟢 Week 3: Conditional Statements
✅ Practice using if, else if, and else
✅ Write code that responds to user input with logic
⏳ Add multiple outcomes based on conditions

🔵 Week 4: Methods
⏳ Define and call custom methods
⏳ Break tasks into reusable functions
⏳ Implement a payroll computation system

🟣 Week 5: Constructors
✅ Learn how to create constructors in classes
✅ Understand how `this` keyword is used
✅ Build objects with data initialized by constructors
✅ Practice with `Movie` and `Employee` examples

🟡 Week 6: Arrays
✅ Learn how to store multiple values in a single variable
✅ Access elements using indexes
✅ Loop through arrays using `for` and enhanced `for-each` loops
✅ Build sample programs like listing movies

🔴 Week 7: Static Keyword
✅ Learn the difference between instance and static variables
✅ Understand how static fields are shared across all objects
✅ Change a static field and see it reflected in all instances
✅ Practice with Employee → StaticExample program

🟢 Week 8: Getters and Setters
✅ Learn how to use getters to safely access private fields
✅ Learn how to use setters to control and validate changes
✅ Understand encapsulation (hiding data inside the class)
✅ Apply `private` fields with `public` getters & setters
✅ Practice with Player class: setting name, age, and color

🧠 Description:  
- Defines `Player` class with private fields  
- Uses setters to assign values with validation (e.g., age > 0)  
- Uses getters to safely read values  
- Demonstrates encapsulation in action  

📌 Practices:  
- Encapsulation  
- Data validation with setters  
- `private` fields + `public` access methods

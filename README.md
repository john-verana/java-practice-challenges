💻 Java Practice Challenges
This repository contains my weekly Java coding practice challenges.
I'm currently learning Java from scratch and using this repo to track my progress and build a strong GitHub portfolio as I grow.

📅 Weekly Focus
✅ Week 1: While Loops
✅ Learn how to repeat logic with a while loop
✅ Apply it in basic interactive apps
✅ Upload at least two working projects

✅ Week 2: User Input (Scanner)
✅ Learn how to take input from users using Scanner
✅ Build basic input/output programs
✅ Handle login attempts with logic and string comparison

🟢 Week 3: Conditional Statements
✅ Practice using if, else if, and else
✅ Write code that responds to user input with logic
⏳ Add multiple outcomes based on conditions

🔵 Week 4: Methods
⏳ Define and call custom methods
⏳ Break tasks into reusable functions
⏳ Implement a payroll computation system

🟣 Week 5: Constructors
✅ Learn how to create constructors in classes
✅ Understand how `this` keyword is used
✅ Build objects with data initialized by constructors
✅ Practice with `Movie` and `Employee` examples

🟡 Week 6: Arrays
✅ Learn how to store multiple values in a single variable
✅ Access elements using indexes
✅ Loop through arrays using `for` and enhanced `for-each` loops
✅ Build sample programs like listing movies

📁 Projects and Challenges
🔁 Vending Machine (While Loop)

🏧 ATM Dispenser (While Loop)  
File: Week1_Loops/ATMDispenser.java  

🔐 Login Prompt (Scanner Input)  
File: Week2_Scanner/LoginPrompt.java  

👴 Age-Based Advice (If-Else If)  
File: Week3_Conditions/IfElseIf.java  

🧠 Description:  
- Asks the user to enter their age  
- Uses multiple if and else if branches to give personalized output  
- Fun logic based on age (drinking/smoking humor)  

📌 Practices:  
- Conditional branching (if, else if, else)  
- Numeric comparisons  
- Scanner input + control flow  

🧮 Payroll System (Methods)  
File: Week4_Methods/Payroll.java  

🧠 Description:  
User Inputs:  
- Basic Pay  
- Work Days  
- Hours per Day  
- Allowance  
- Premium  
- Loan Deduction  
- Overtime Hours  

Calculations via methods:  
- `perHour(basicPay, workDays, workHours)` → hourly rate  
- `perDay(basicPay, workDays)` → daily rate  
- `addMonthly(basicPay, allowance, premium)` → monthly pay  
- `calculateTax(basicPay, taxRate)` → tax amount  
- `calculateNetPay(monthlyPay, tax)` → net pay  
- `totalPay(monthlyPay, tax, loan)` → final take-home  

Formatting: Outputs formatted as ₱ with two decimal places  

📌 Practices:  
- Method creation & calls  
- Parameter passing & return values  
- Modular code design  
- Scanner input & System.out.printf  

🎬 Movie Info (Constructors)

👨‍💼 Employee Info (Constructors)  
Files: Week5_Constructors/Employee.java, Week5_Constructors/ConstructorEmployee.java  

🧠 Description:  
- Define classes (`Movie`, `Employee`)  
- Use constructors to initialize object data  
- Display object info with methods  

📌 Practices:  
- Constructors  
- Object creation with parameters  
- `this` keyword usage  

🎥 Arrays Sample (Movies List)  
File: Week6_Arrays/ArraysSample.java  

🧠 Description:  
- Store and display multiple movie names  
- Access array elements using indexes  
- Loop through arrays with `for` and `for-each`  

📌 Practices:  
- Arrays  
- Index access  
- Iterating with loops

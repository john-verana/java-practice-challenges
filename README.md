# 💻 Java Practice Challenges

This repository contains my weekly Java coding practice challenges.  
I'm currently learning Java from scratch and using this repo to track my progress and build a strong GitHub portfolio as I grow.

### 🏧 ATM Dispenser (While Loop)
**File:** [`Week1_Loops/ATMDispenser.java`](Week1_Loops/ATMDispenser.java)

### 🔐 Login Prompt (Scanner Input)
**File:** [`Week2_Scanner/LoginPrompt.java`](Week2_Scanner/LoginPrompt.java)

### 👴 Age-Based Advice (If-Else If)
**File:** [`Week3_Conditions/IfElseIf.java`](Week3_Conditions/IfElseIf.java)

🧠 **Description:**
- Asks the user to enter their age
- Uses multiple `if` and `else if` branches to give personalized output
- Fun logic based on age (drinking/smoking humor)

📌 **Practices:**
- Conditional branching (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Numeric comparisons
- Scanner input + control flow

# 💻 Java Practice Challenges

This repository contains my weekly Java coding practice challenges.
I'm currently learning Java from scratch and using this repo to track my progress and build a strong GitHub portfolio as I grow.

## 📅 Weekly Focus

### ✅ Week 1: While Loops

* ✅ Learn how to repeat logic with a `while` loop
* ✅ Apply it in basic interactive apps
* ✅ Upload at least two working projects

### ✅ Week 2: User Input (Scanner)

* ✅ Learn how to take input from users using `Scanner`
* ✅ Build basic input/output programs
* ✅ Handle login attempts with logic and string comparison

### 🟢 Week 3: Conditional Statements

* ✅ Practice using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
* ✅ Write code that responds to user input with logic
* ⏳ Add multiple outcomes based on conditions

### 🔵 Week 4: Methods

* ⏳ Define and call custom methods
* ⏳ Break tasks into reusable functions
* ⏳ Implement a payroll computation system

### 🟣 Week 5: Constructors

* ✅ Learn how to define and use constructors in Java
* ✅ Understand `this` keyword for assigning instance variables
* ✅ Create objects with pre-initialized values
* ✅ Display object data using methods

## 📁 Projects and Challenges

### 🔁 Vending Machine (While Loop)

**File:** [`Week1_Loops/VendingMachine.java`](Week1_Loops/VendingMachine.java)

### 🏧 ATM Dispenser (While Loop)

**File:** [`Week1_Loops/ATMDispenser.java`](Week1_Loops/ATMDispenser.java)

### 🔐 Login Prompt (Scanner Input)

**File:** [`Week2_Scanner/LoginPrompt.java`](Week2_Scanner/LoginPrompt.java)

### 👴 Age-Based Advice (If-Else If)

**File:** [`Week3_Conditions/IfElseIf.java`](Week3_Conditions/IfElseIf.java)

🧠 **Description:**

* Asks the user to enter their age
* Uses multiple `if` and `else if` branches to give personalized output
* Fun logic based on age (drinking/smoking humor)

📌 **Practices:**

* Conditional branching (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
* Numeric comparisons
* Scanner input + control flow

### 🧮 Payroll System (Methods)

**File:** [`Week4_Methods/Payroll.java`](Week4_Methods/Payroll.java)

🧠 **Description:**

**User Inputs:**

* Basic Pay
* Work Days
* Hours per Day
* Allowance
* Premium
* Loan Deduction
* Overtime Hours

**Calculations via methods:**

* `perHour(basicPay, workDays, workHours)` → hourly rate
* `perDay(basicPay, workDays)` → daily rate
* `addMonthly(basicPay, allowance, premium)` → monthly pay
* `calculateTax(basicPay, taxRate)` → tax amount
* `calculateNetPay(monthlyPay, tax)` → net pay
* `totalPay(monthlyPay, tax, loan)` → final take-home

**Formatting:** Outputs formatted as ₱ with two decimal places

📌 **Practices:**

* Method creation & calls
* Parameter passing & return values
* Modular code design
* Scanner input & `System.out.printf`

### 🎬 Movie Info (Constructors)

**Files:**

* [`Week5_Constructors/Movie.java`](Week5_Constructors/Movie.java)
* [`Week5_Constructors/Constructor.java`](Week5_Constructors/Constructor.java)

🧠 **Description:**

* Demonstrates how to use constructors to initialize object properties
* Uses the `this` keyword to assign values to instance variables
* Creates multiple objects with different data
* Displays movie details using a method

📌 **Practices:**

* Defining constructors
* Using `this` keyword
* Object creation and initialization
* Method calls on objects
